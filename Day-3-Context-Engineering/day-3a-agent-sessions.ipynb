    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *User Input*: A message from the user (text, audio, image, etc.)\n",
    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The field of AI in healthcare is moving incredibly fast, so \"latest\" is a moving target! However, here are some of the key areas and recent developments that are making headlines and driving progress:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Drug Discovery and Development:**\n",
      "*   **Accelerated Discovery:** AI algorithms are proving highly effective at identifying potential drug candidates, predicting their efficacy, and understanding complex biological interactions. This is significantly speeding up the early stages of drug discovery, which traditionally takes years and billions of dollars.\n",
      "*   **Personalized Medicine:** AI is helping to tailor drug treatments to individual patients based on their genetic makeup, lifestyle, and medical history. This promises more effective treatments with fewer side effects.\n",
      "*   **Clinical Trial Optimization:** AI is being used to identify suitable patients for clinical trials, predict trial outcomes, and even design more efficient trial protocols.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Diagnostics and Imaging:**\n",
      "*   **Enhanced Image Analysis:** AI, particularly deep learning, is revolutionizing the analysis of medical images like X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, and pathology slides. It can detect subtle anomalies that human eyes might miss, aiding in earlier and more accurate diagnoses of conditions like cancer, diabetic retinopathy, and cardiovascular diseases.\n",
      "*   **Predictive Diagnostics:** AI models are being developed to predict a patient's risk of developing certain diseases before symptoms even appear, allowing for proactive interventions.\n",
      "*   **Radiology Assistance:** AI tools are increasingly acting as \"second readers\" for radiologists, helping to flag potential issues and improve workflow efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Personalized Treatment and Patient Management:**\n",
      "*   **Treatment Recommendation Systems:** AI can analyze vast amounts of patient data to recommend the most effective treatment plans for specific conditions and individuals.\n",
      "*   **Remote Patient Monitoring:** Wearable devices and AI-powered platforms are enabling continuous monitoring of patients at home, allowing for early detection of deteriorating conditions and reducing hospital readmissions.\n",
      "*   **Virtual Assistants and Chatbots:** AI-powered chatbots are being used for patient triage, answering common medical questions, scheduling appointments, and providing medication reminders, freeing up healthcare professionals' time.\n",
      "\n",

      "*   **Binding Affinity and Efficacy Prediction:** More accurate AI models can predict how strongly a drug candidate will bind to its target and its likely efficacy, guiding chemists towards the most promising molecules.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Accelerating Pre-clinical and Clinical Development:**\n",
      "*   **In Silico Trials:** While not replacing real trials yet, AI is being used to simulate aspects of drug efficacy and safety, helping to optimize study designs and potentially reduce the need for certain animal studies.\n",
      "*   **Biomarker Discovery:** AI can identify novel biomarkers that predict patient response to a drug, enabling more targeted and effective clinical trials and the development of companion diagnostics.\n",
      "*   **Repurposing Existing Drugs:** AI algorithms are excellent at scanning vast databases of approved drugs and scientific literature to identify existing medications that could be effective for new diseases. This is a faster and often less expensive route to new therapies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Specialized AI Platforms and Tools:**\n",
      "*   **Automated Chemistry Labs:** Companies are integrating AI with robotic automation to create \"closed-loop\" systems where AI designs molecules, robots synthesize them, and AI analyzes their properties, creating a rapid feedback cycle.\n",

      "Many biotech and pharmaceutical companies are heavily investing in AI for drug discovery. Some prominent names include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Insilico Medicine**\n",
      "*   **Exscientia**\n",

      "\n",
      "Despite these challenges, the pace of innovation is astounding. We are seeing AI move from being a supporting tool to a **core engine** driving the entire drug discovery pipeline.\n",
      "\n",
      " ### Session: compaction_demo\n",
      "\n",
      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're likely referring to the **\"Advanced Target Identification and Validation\"** development. This is a really crucial area because if you don't identify the right target, even the most brilliant drug design will fail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a deeper dive into what's happening with AI in target identification and validation:\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Core Problem:**\n",
      "Diseases are complex, and often involve multiple biological pathways and components. Identifying the *single* most critical molecule or pathway (the \"target\") to interact with to treat a disease effectively, without causing unacceptable side effects, is incredibly challenging. Traditional methods often rely on serendipity, extensive trial-and-error, or focusing on well-understood targets, which can limit innovation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification & Validation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Multi-omics Integration:**\n",
      "    *   **What it is:** \"Omics\" refers to different layers of biological data:\n",
      "        *   **Genomics:** The complete set of genes in an organism.\n",
      "        *   **Transcriptomics:** Which genes are being \"turned on\" and transcribed into RNA.\n",
      "        *   **Proteomics:** The full set of proteins being produced.\n",
      "        *   **Metabolomics:** The complete set of small molecules (metabolites) involved in cell processes.\n",
      "        *   **Epigenomics:** Modifications to DNA that affect gene activity without changing the DNA sequence itself.\n",
      "        *   And increasingly, data from the **microbiome** (the community of microorganisms in our bodies) and **patient electronic health records (EHRs)**.\n",
      "    *   **AI's Role:** Humans struggle to synthesize and find meaningful patterns across these massive, diverse datasets. AI algorithms, especially machine learning, can analyze these integrated datasets to find subtle correlations and deviations that point to specific biological players involved in a disease. For example, AI might identify a protein whose expression is consistently altered across multiple omics layers in diseased cells, making it a strong candidate target.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Causality Inference (Moving Beyond Correlation):**\n",
      "    *   **The Challenge:** A common issue in biology is observing that two things happen together (correlation), but not knowing if one causes the other. For instance, a gene might be highly expressed in cancer, but is it *causing* the cancer, or is it a *result* of the cancer process?\n",
      "    *   **AI's Role:** Sophisticated AI techniques are being developed to infer causal relationships. These methods analyze data over time, or from different experimental conditions, to build models that suggest cause-and-effect. This is crucial for selecting targets that, when inhibited or activated, will *reverse* or *prevent* the disease process, not just be a bystander molecule. Mendelian Randomization, a statistical approach often powered by AI, is a key technique here.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Network Biology Analysis:**\n",
      "    *   **What it is:** Cells and organisms are not just a collection of individual molecules; they are intricate networks where everything is interconnected. A \"disease\" often represents a disruption in these biological networks.\n",
      "    *   **AI's Role:** AI can map these complex networks (e.g., protein-protein interaction networks, gene regulatory networks) and identify \"bottlenecks,\" \"hubs,\" or critical \"motifs\" within them. By understanding how these networks function and are disrupted, AI can pinpoint targets that, when acted upon, have a cascading effect to restore healthy network function. This is particularly useful for complex diseases with multiple contributing factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Leveraging \"Undruggable\" Targets:**\n",
      "    *   **The Problem:** Many proteins that are strongly implicated in diseases (like certain transcription factors or signaling proteins) have historically been considered \"undruggable\" because they lack a clear binding pocket or are difficult to target with traditional small molecules or antibodies.\n",
      "    *   **AI's Role:** AI is helping to uncover new ways to target these difficult proteins. This could involve:\n",
      "        *   Identifying **allosteric sites** (sites other than the primary active site) that can modulate protein function.\n",
      "        *   Designing **novel modalities** beyond small molecules and antibodies, such as protein degraders (e.g., PROTACs), or RNA-targeting drugs.\n",
      "        *   Predicting protein structures with unprecedented accuracy (e.g., AlphaFold), which provides detailed insights for targeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Impact and Benefits:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Efficiency:** Dramatically speeds up the identification of promising drug targets.\n",
      "*   **Novelty:** Uncovers targets that might have been missed by human intuition or traditional methods.\n",
      "*   **Reduced Risk:** By validating targets more rigorously early on, it reduces the chance of investing heavily in drugs that will fail due to an invalid target.\n",
      "*   **Broader Disease Coverage:** Opens up possibilities for developing treatments for diseases that have long been intractable.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, AI is equipping researchers with powerful analytical lenses and predictive engines to navigate the immense complexity of human biology, leading to the identification of more precise and effective targets for new medicines.\n",
