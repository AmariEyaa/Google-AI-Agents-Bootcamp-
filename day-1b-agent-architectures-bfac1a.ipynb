    "\n",
    "Just like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n",

    "- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n",
    "- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n",
    "- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n",

      "The journey of software development is constantly evolving. By embracing the principles of Multi-Agent Systems, developers are not just building software; they are crafting intelligent, resilient, and scalable ecosystems that can tackle challenges previously deemed insurmountable. It's time to move beyond the confines of traditional approaches and unlock the transformative potential of agent-based computing for your next project.\n",

Enter Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) – a paradigm shift that's empowering developers to create more robust, adaptable, and sophisticated applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most significant advantages of MAS is **enhanced parallelism and scalability**. Imagine tasks executing concurrently, with independent agents handling different operations simultaneously. This naturally leads to distributed problem-solving, allowing your applications to scale horizontally by simply adding more agents, rather than being constrained by brute-force hardware upgrades. Intelligent resource management further optimizes this process.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAS also significantly boosts **robustness and fault tolerance**. With decentralized control, there's no single point of failure. If one agent malfunctions, others can often compensate, leading to self-healing capabilities and graceful degradation. This makes your systems far more resilient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, MAS enables **intelligent decision-making and adaptability**. Agents can act autonomously, learn from their experiences, and adapt their behavior over time. This is invaluable for modeling and managing intricate real-world systems, from supply chains to traffic control.\n",

      "*   **Deepen Elias's reaction to the map:** While Elias feels a \"shiver of the unknown,\" exploring his specific thoughts and feelings further could enhance the impact. Is he fearful, excited, bewildered? Does this discovery challenge his lifelong understanding of the sea and the world? A sentence or two delving into his internal monologue would add depth.\n",
      "*   **Hint at the origin or nature of the parchment:** The parchment's luminescent glow and strange symbols are immediately captivating. Consider adding a subtle hint or question about its origin. Is it ancient, magical, or something else entirely? This could be a brief observation from Elias, such as noticing the texture of the parchment or a fleeting thought about how it might have gotten there.\n",
      "*   **Expand on the \"strange hum\":** The \"strange hum\" vibrating through the tower is a good detail that adds to the sense of unease. Briefly connecting this hum to the discovery of the parchment, or suggesting Elias wonders if they are related, could weave the elements of the mystery together more tightly. For example, did the hum intensify when he found the parchment?\n",

For thirty years, the lighthouse had been his world, a stone sentinel against the sea's fury. Tonight, however, felt different.

      "\n",
      "While securing a loose shutter, his boot struck something hidden beneath a pile of old netting. A rolled parchment. It unfurled in his calloused hands, not with the brittle crackle of aged paper, but with a soft, luminescent glow that cast an eerie blue light on his weathered face. Intricate, unfamiliar symbols pulsed with a cool, cerulean light, depicting constellations he’d never charted and an island that existed on no known map. Elias, the man who knew every rock and current for miles, felt a shiver of the unknown trace its way up his spine. Was this magic? Or something even older? The parchment felt strangely smooth, almost alive beneath his fingertips. He looked around the tower, a sudden urge to connect the inexplicable hum to this bizarre discovery washing over him. Had the hum intensified when he’d disturbed the netting? The sea outside roared, a violent counterpoint to the silent, glowing enigma in his hands, but the true mystery now lay within his grasp. He clutched the parchment, a bewildered excitement warring with a nascent fear. His world, so meticulously charted by the predictable cycles of tide and star, had just cracked wide open.\n",
      "CriticAgent > The story is off to a strong start, effectively establishing atmosphere and a compelling mystery. Elias is a relatable protagonist, and the discovery of the parchment is intriguing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are 2-3 specific, actionable suggestions for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clarify the relationship between the hum and the parchment:** While Elias *feels* an urge to connect them, the connection isn't yet explicit. Consider a moment where Elias actively observes a change in the hum when he finds or touches the parchment. For example, \"As his fingers brushed the parchment's strange, smooth surface, the hum in the stone seemed to pulse, a brief, synchronous thrum that made him jump.\" This makes the link more concrete and heightens the supernatural element.\n",
      "*   **Show, don't just tell, Elias's internal conflict:** The phrase \"a bewildered excitement warring with a nascent fear\" is a good starting point. To make this more visceral, consider showing Elias's physical reactions. Does his hand tremble as he clutches the parchment? Does his breath hitch? Does he instinctively look towards the sea for reassurance or a further clue, only to find the storm mirroring his inner turmoil?\n",
      "*   **Refine the ending to leave a stronger hook:** The sentence \"His world, so meticulously charted by the predictable cycles of tide and star, had just cracked wide open\" is a solid concluding thought. However, to propel the reader further, consider adding a more immediate, forward-looking element. Perhaps Elias makes a decision, however small, about what to do next, or a new, more pressing question arises directly from the parchment itself. For instance, \"He traced a line on the map, a path leading to the impossible island, and a single, burning question formed in his mind: *Who made this, and why did they leave it for me?*\"\n",
